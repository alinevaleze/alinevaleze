## 👋 Hi there I'm Aline Valeze

 👩‍💻 Passionate about technology and driven by the thrill of problem-solving, I am a software developer with a diverse background. Originally from São Paulo, I spent a decade in London, honing my English fluency and gaining invaluable experiences. Currently based in Lisbon, I am immersed in the vibrant tech scene of this beautiful city.


After years of exploring my interests, I found my true passion in programming. I transitioned from a love for 👩‍🍳 culinary arts to a career in software development. My journey has been marked by continuous learning and growth, as I strive to enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
Specializing in web development, I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My experience encompasses both front-end and back-end development, with a keen focus on creating intuitive and efficient solutions.
Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for Italian cuisine 🍝 – both in savoring its flavors and mastering its recipes. In my leisure time, you'll often find me experimenting in the kitchen or indulging in a game. Balancing work and play is key to maintaining creativity and productivity.


I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals, share insights, and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out – let's embark on this journey together!
